CPCD App is a desktop application designed exclusively for PCs that provides advanced control over your operating system. This tool ensures distraction-free operation by limiting keyboard and mouse usage and allowing you to customize keyboard shortcuts for safe exit.

Focused on performance and system control, CPCD is ideal for scenarios requiring full-screen lock or focus modes on Windows and Linux (future) platforms, with new features such as multi-monitor support, process control and advanced security capabilities.
