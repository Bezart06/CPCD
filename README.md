<h1 align="center">CPCD</h1>

CPCD is a desktop application for PC designed to provide enhanced control over your operating system environment. It helps by limiting keyboard input (and potentially mouse usage in the future) and obscuring the screen, allowing for a distraction-free operational mode. Safe exit is managed via a specific keyboard shortcut.

Currently, in version 0.1.0, CPCD offers core full-screen input locking functionality for **Windows**. Future development aims to expand features and include support for Linux platforms.

## Current Features (v0.1.0 - Windows)

* **Full-Screen Lock:** Engages a mode that covers the entire screen.
* **Keyboard Input Blocking:** Prevents most keyboard interactions while active.
* **Safe Exit:** Use **Right Ctrl + Right Alt** to exit the locked mode.

## Demo

*(A demonstration video will be available in future updates.)*

## Screenshots

*(Screenshots will be added soon to illustrate the application in action.)*


## Installation

### From Source

To build CPCD from source, you'll need a C++ compiler (supporting C++23) and CMake.

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/bezart06/CPCD.git
    cd CPCD\
    ```
2.  Create a build directory and compile:
    ```bash
    mkdir build
    cd build\
    cmake ..
    cmake --build . --config Release
    ```
    The executable `CPCD.exe` will be located in the `build/Release` (or `build/`) directory.

### From Releases

Pre-compiled executables for Windows (version 0.1.0) are available on the [GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/Bezart06/CPCD/releases).
